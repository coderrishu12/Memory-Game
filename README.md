## Code Overview

Here's a brief overview of the main components in the code:

### `App.js`

- **State Management**: Manages the state of the cards, the choices made by the player, the number of turns, and whether the cards are disabled during comparison.
- **Shuffling Cards**: Randomizes and shuffles the cards and initializes the game state.
- **Handling Choices**: Tracks the player's choices and checks for matches.
- **Effect Hooks**: Utilizes `useEffect` to handle side effects like card comparison and game initialization.

### `SingleCard.js`

This component is responsible for rendering individual cards, handling user interactions, and displaying whether a card is flipped or matched.
